# Migrating or Offboarding Your PostgreSQL Databases

This document provides instructions about:

* migrating your PostgreSQL databases from the proof-of-concept (POC) environment to your new FSDH workspace in the production (PROD) environment
* offboarding your PostgreSQL databases from the POC environment should you not be shifting your research to the PROD environment

Please note: to avoid data loss, you must complete migration or offboarding by March 31, 2025.

## A. Migrating from POC to PROD

In order to migrate your PostgreSQL databases, you must have a new workspace in the PROD environment. For guidance on setting up your workspace please refer to [URL] or reach out to the Federal Science DataHub support team.

Once you have a workspace in the PROD environment, the Federal Science DataHub support team can assist you with migrating your PostgreSQL databases. Please submit a Support Request to get started.

Alternatively, you can migrate your PostgreSQL databases yourself as follows:

### Step 1. Create a Dump of Your Database

Whether you are migrating your PostgreSQL databases to your new workspace in the PROD environment or offboarding them from the POC environment, you should start by creating a dump of your databases. This dump will be used to either import your databases into the PROD environment or to store them for future use.

You can choose one of the following three ways to create a dump.

#### Option 1: Create a Dump Using `pg_dump`

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using `psql` or a similar tool.

2. Run the following command to create a dump of your database:

```bash
pg_dump -U <username> -d <database_name> -f <dump_file_name>.sql
```

Replace `<username>` with your PostgreSQL username, `<database_name>` with the name of the database you want to dump, and `<dump_file_name>` with the name you want to give to the dump file.

3. Validate that the dump file has been created successfully by checking the file location.

#### Option 2: Create a Dump Using pgAdmin

1. Open pgAdmin and connect to your PostgreSQL database.

2. Right-click on the database you want to dump and select `Backup...`.

3. In the `Backup Options` tab, select the format for the backup file (e.g., `Plain`).

4. In the `Filename` field, specify the location and name of the dump file.

5. Click `Backup` to create the dump file.

6. Validate that the dump file has been created successfully by checking the file location.

#### Option 3: Create a Dump Using DBeaver

1. Open DBeaver and connect to your PostgreSQL database.

2. Right-click on the database you want to dump and select `Tools` > `Export Database`.

3. In the `Export Settings` tab, select the format for the export file (e.g., `SQL`).

4. In the `Output File` field, specify the location and name of the dump file.

5. Click `Finish` to create the dump file.

6. Validate that the dump file has been created successfully by checking the file location.

### Step 2. Import PostgreSQL to Your Workspace in the PROD Environment

Once you've created the dump files (Step 1), you can import your databases into the PROD environment using one of the three options below.

#### Option 1: Import Dump Using `psql`

1. Connect to the PROD PostgreSQL database using `psql` or a similar tool.

2. Run the following command to import the dump file into the PROD database:

```bash
psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -f <dump_file_name>.sql
```

Replace `<username>` with your PostgreSQL username, `<database_name>` with the name of the database you want to import into, and `<dump_file_name>` with the name of the dump file.

3. Validate that the import process was successful by checking the PROD database.

#### Option 2: Import Dump Using pgAdmin

1. Open pgAdmin and connect to the PROD PostgreSQL database.

2. Right-click on the database you want to import into and select `Restore...`.

3. In the `Restore Options` tab, select the dump file you created in the previous step.

4. Click `Restore` to import the dump file into the PROD database.

5. Validate that the import process was successful by checking the PROD database.

#### Option 3: Import Dump Using DBeaver

1. Open DBeaver and connect to the PROD PostgreSQL database.

2. Right-click on the database you want to import into and select `Tools` > `Import Database`.

3. In the `Import Settings` tab, select the format of the import file (e.g., `SQL`).

4. In the `Input File` field, select the dump file you created in the previous step.

5. Click `Finish` to import the dump file into the PROD database.

6. Validate that the import process was successful by checking the PROD database.

## C. Offboarding PostgreSQL from POC

If you are not moving to the PROD environment, you can simply store the dump files created in Step 1 above for future use or for archival purposes.

## D. Support

If you encounter any issues during the migration process, please contact the Federal Science DataHub support team by submitting a Support Request. Our team is happy to assist with migrating or offboarding your databases.
