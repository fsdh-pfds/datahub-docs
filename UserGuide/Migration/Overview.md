# Migration Overview

In Fall 2024, the Federal Science DataHub will begin concluding the proof-of-concept (POC) phase and transitioning to the production (PROD) phase.

To prepare you for this transition, we have created a series of migration guides to help you migrate your data, storage, web apps, and Databricks workspaces from the POC environment to the PROD environment or to offboard them from the POC environment.

This document provides general information about the migration process. You can find detailed instructions on how to migrate specific resources in the sidebar.

## Migration Timeline

The migration process will begin in Fall 2024. We will inform you when the PROD environment is ready for migration at a later date.

Migration must be completed by March 31, 2025. After this date, the POC environment will be decommissioned, and all resources will be deleted.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need to migrate my resources?

Migrating your resources from the POC environment to the PROD environment ensures that your data and applications are preserved and accessible in the long term. It also allows you to take advantage of the enhanced features and capabilities of the PROD environment.

### What is the difference between migration and offboarding?

- **Migration:** Moving your resources from the POC environment to the PROD environment.
- **Offboarding:** Removing your resources from the POC environment without migrating them to the PROD environment.

### What resources can be migrated?

You can migrate all resources provisioned in the POC environment, including databases, storage, web apps, and Databricks workspaces.

### What happens if I do not migrate my resources?

If you do not migrate your resources by the deadline, they will be lost when the POC environment is decommissioned. Make sure to migrate your resources before the deadline to avoid data loss.

### How can I get help with migration?

If you encounter any issues during the migration process, please contact the Federal Science DataHub support team by submitting a Support Request. Our team is happy to assist with migration or offboarding your resources.
