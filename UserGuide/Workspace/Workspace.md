# FSDH Workspace

A Workspace provides easy access to the key features in the Federal Science DataHub

- Storage (Azure Blob Storage)
  - To collaborate on datasets, FSDH Workspaces enable the creation of cloud Storage Accounts. Workspace Storage allows you to upload and store data to share with colleagues. Your colleague(s) must be a member of your Workspace -- members are listed on your Workspace page.
  - Storage Accounts can be provisioned for all users and provide a way to collaborate and exchange large data sets between users from different departments.
- Data analytics tools (Azure Databricks)
- Add Collaborators

## Support Features

### Temporary Administrative Access to FSDH Support Team

To let the FSDH support team investigate issues with a workspace, access to resources can simplify the support process and allow the team to diagnose and reproduce issues or help with deployed resources.

The setting lets the FSDH team add and remove members to the workspace and add required support personal to an existing workspace. It is the FSDH support team responsibility to remove themselves from the workspace after the support work is completed. In the future, all accounts in a workspace will have an expiry date in future release.

### Enable FSDH Support Team to read workspace data

This setting allows the FSDH team to access deployed web applications and browse the storage account.
This setting is enabled by default.
