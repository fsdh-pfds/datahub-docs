# Workspace Leads Onboard supplementary Information Kit

## Terms and Conditions

It is mandatory for workspace leads to review the T&C to understand the security responsibilities, scope, limitations, best practices and costing of the FSDH platform.

## Backup of Data and Code

Although redundancy has been considered at the base of the FSDH platform, it is under responsibility of the workspace owner to make sure the data and code are available in the case of system failure. In practice, this can be achieved by maintaining a copy outside FSDH. 

FSDH recommends:
- Keep your code (such as notebooks) in a Git repository of your choice and connect FSDH to it;
- Keep another copy of your critical data in your departmental facilities;
- Keep your Databricks configuration and settings in a note;
