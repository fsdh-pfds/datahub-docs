# Workspace Leads Onboard supplementary Information Kit

## Terms and Conditions

It is mandatory for workspace leads to review the T&C to understand the security responsibilities, scope, limitations, best practices and costing of the FSDH platform.

## Backup of Data and Code

Although redundancy has been considered at the base of the FSDH platform, it is under responsibility of the workspace owner to make sure the data and code are available in the case of system failure. In practice, this can be achieved by maintaining a copy outside FSDH. 

FSDH recommends:
- Keep your code (such as notebooks) in a Git repository of your choice and connect FSDH to it;
- Keep another copy of your critical data in your departmental facilities;
- Keep your Databricks configuration and settings in a note;

## Usage Monitor

The workspace lead or delegated personnel need to review the workspace usage to identify inappropriate usage and report to FSDH if unusual usage is noticed. FSDH team can provide help in doubt but will not regularly monior the workspaces.

If FSDH identifies unauthorized or inappropriate usage of FSDH workspaces, FSDH is obliged to report IT Security for further corrective measures.

## Source Code

The workspace lead must ensure the use of open source meets licensing requirements and that the source code is protected from unauthorized modification. FSDH recommends workspaces to use external reputable Git repositories (such as Github) to save and safeguard the source code.

# Personnel
It is the responsibility of the workspace leads to make sure all users must have valid Enhanced Reliability security clearance prior to adding them to FSDH workspaces.

Upon termination of individual employment, the workspace lead must:
- Disables FSDH workspace access within 7 days.
- Advise FSDH of the termination so that FSDH can terminate system wide access.
- Retrieves all security-related organizational information system-related property.
