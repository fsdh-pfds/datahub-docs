## How to list all the events for a specific user?

Type: 

```
customEvents
| where customDimensions.userName == "FULL_USER_NAME"

```

Or 

```
customEvents
| where customDimensions.userName contains "A_NAME"

```

## How to list data events?

```
customEvents
| where name == "DataEvent"
```

The filters can be combined with ands of extra 'where' clauses, for example, all the data events for a user named "John"

```
customEvents
| where customDimensions.userName contains "A_NAME"
| where name == "DataEvent"
```

DataEvents are changes performed to the DB related to the actions performed by the logged user.

Note: We store event related properties in the customDimensions of the event. For example:
```
	AspNetCoreEnvironment: dev
	changeType: Delete
	objectId: MetadataProfile {ProfileId: 4} Deleted
	table: MetadataProfile
	userId: 34a16480-1c78-4b65-933f-c6cce336346b
	userName: Iroel Perez-Garcia
	userPrincipalName: iperez_apption.com#EXT#@163oxygen.onmicrosoft.com
```    
	
### Example 1: Project_User changes

The following query lists all database changes that occured for table `Project_Users`.

```kql
// Query to list events where customDimensions "table" is "Project_Users"
customEvents
| where customDimensions.changeDetails startswith "Datahub_Project_User"
| project timestamp, name, customDimensions
```
