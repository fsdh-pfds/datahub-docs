# Member of GoC

## Signup/enrollment process for GoC

Users will complete a form, provide their email and other DataHub project details. The entry will be validated by DataHub and user added as external user in a dedicated AAD group. Data owner would need to be figured out (IDM?)

## Termination date

Access to the DataHub would be renewed periodically.

## Scenario 1: SSC Partner Department/B2B

The active directory of the department is federated and connected with the DataHub/SSC AAD (cross-tenant trust). GoC members will be external users in the DataHub/SSC AAD and leverage the identity validation of the department.

*Action* Confirm targetted depts are in list of SSC Partner Department

*Action* Confirm with Enterprise SSC team, might require a separate tenant

## Scenario 2: Non Partner Department

All departments are not in the SSC Partner Department list. Out of scope for MVP?
Additional steps in the process will be required.

*Action*: need list of departments and see if they need to onboard to DataHub

# Collaborators

## Science and research owner

Position would be determined.

## Workflow to activate collaborators (academia/companies)

Anyone can submit but only owner can approve.

1. Signed users from GoC go in DataHub projects/Invite collaborators
1. The GoC member would fill a form with
  1. Full name, email address, company, snail mail address, user vouching
1. the Data Project administrator / Science and research owner
  1. Need to validate that they have a MOU in place  
  1. Data owner will validate and approve the request
  1. Email needs to be validated
  1. Collaborator is added to the repository

_Academia workflow could be simplified with Canarie FIR_
