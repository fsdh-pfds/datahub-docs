# Initiative Administration

## Accessing the page

This page can be opened by navigating to the DataHub Administration section using the Admin link in the navigation bar, then opening the page from the **Manage Initiatives** box in the administration menu.

## Initiative Access Requests

Here, initiative administrators can see user requests for access to initiatives, as well as users that have been granted access. Requests can be actioned by either **Authorizing** the user (granting access) or **Deleting** the access request.

## DataHub Initiative Tracker

DataHub administrators have access to an additional tab with a shortcut to open the DataHub Initiative Tracker, which allows them to create, edit and manage data initiatives.
