# DataHub Initiative Tracker

The DataHub Initiative Tracker is used by DataHub administrators to create, edit and manage data initiatives. This includes entering and updating initiative information such as the name of the initiative, contact information, and initiative status.

New initiatives may also be created using this interface. However, the preferred method is for users to fill out and submit an Onboarding form with their initiative's information, which can then be approved and created by an administrator.
