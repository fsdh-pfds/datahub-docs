# Initiative Administration

## Accessing the page

This page can be opened by navigating to the DataHub Administration section using the Admin link in the navigation bar, then opening the page from the **Manage Services in Initiatives** box in the administration menu.

## Service Creation Requests

In this section, administrators can view requests for the creation of services, including Power BI, PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases, and initiative storage. After a service has been created, the user requesting the service can be notified from this page.

Some services, such as Power BI, can be created directly from this page. However, others may be provisioned automatically, or need to be created through external means.

For Power BI requests, the administrator can review and update the name of the Power BI workspaces to be created. Once approved, the workspaces will automatically be linked to the corresponding data initiative, and will be accessible through the initiative's Power BI pane.
