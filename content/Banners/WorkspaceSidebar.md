# Using the workspace sidebar

![WorkspaceSidebar](https://github.com/ssc-sp/datahub-docs/assets/56747050/d0537632-9520-4110-b7d6-3771bfc2fd95)

The first section of our workspace sidebar displays the different tools that are built within our workspace. A new workspace will only have the dashboard available, but as your project grows, you will have several tools available to you,
such as Databricks, file storage, databases, web applications and more!

The second section of the sidebar is where you manage your workspace:
- **Toolbox**: Request new tools for your workspace.
- **Users**: Manage workspace users and their roles and permissions.
- **Metadata**: Provide additional information regarding your workspace.
- **Reports**: Access costing and storage information of your workspace.
- **Settings**: Define other settings pertaining to your workspace.

**NOTE**: The first step of a new workspace is always to fill out the metadata! Without having filled your workspace metadata you _cannot_ request new tools from the toolbox. Let us have a look at metadata!
