# The first step towards success: metadata

In order to do anything in your workspace, it is required that you fill out your project metadata. Metadata is information about the project, such as a description, keywords and organization, that allow us to have a better idea
of your needs and that will allow peers outside of your workspace to get an idea of what you're doing!

Make sure you fill out all of the required information and that you **click "Save Metadata"** at the bottom! You are asked to provide information in both official languages for some of the fields, but you can use the "Google translate" button to
automatically populate the missing language.
