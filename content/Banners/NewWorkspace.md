Clicking the "New" button in the workspace section of the sidebar will open a pop-up which will guide you in the creation of your very own workspace! Once you are done selecting a name, an acronym will be auto-generated for you, but you may change it! 

Happy with your workspace name and acronym? Click on "Create workspace" and your new workspace will soon appear in the sidebar!
