## Workspace Storage

The Federal Science DataHub uses Azure Storage, Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for a variety of data objects in the cloud. 

There are two key types of storage accounts:

- **Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen2)** - designed for big data analytics and provides Access Control Lists at the file and folder level
- **Azure Blob Storage** - basic storage account - doesn't provide Access Control at the file and folder level but is required for compatibility in certain scenarios.
