There are two important sections of the page when working within a workspace:

1. **Sidebar**: This is where you can navigate to the different tools in your workspace, as well as manage the workspace itself. As we are just getting started, there may not be any available tools in your brand new workspace but we will get there!
2. **Content**: This is where your selected tool will be displayed and where you will do your work! In the picture above, the workspace dashboard is displayed, where you can see an overview of your workspace, its tools, its members and its incurred costs
