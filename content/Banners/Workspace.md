## Workspaces

A workspace in the Federal Science Datahub is a collection of cloud resources along with a list of members. The cloud
resources within your workspace (e.g. storage accounts, etc.) are only accessible by the members of your workspace and
can
only be managed by workspace admins or leads.

A FSDH workspace is the perfect place to collaborate with GC colleagues, share data and analytics, and build research or
business projects.
