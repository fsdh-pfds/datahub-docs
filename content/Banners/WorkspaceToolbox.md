# Requesting tools in the toolbox

![ezgif-5-a4f368af5f](https://github.com/ssc-sp/datahub-docs/assets/56747050/6176805d-573e-4a6a-9641-d704a6beb02f)

Once your metadata is complete and you have invited your colleagues in your workspace, the final step is to request the tools necessary to your project!

To do so, navigate to the toolbox, where you will see all of the tools currently available in FSDH, ensure you read and understand the description of each tool and request the ones you need simply by clicking the "Add to workspace"
button!

Once you add a tool to your workspace, it may take up to 30 minutes before it appears in your sidebar, at which point you will be able to use it by simply clicking on it. If you have any issues or concerns regarding requesting tools,
feel free to contact us.

**Congratulations on creating your workspace!**
