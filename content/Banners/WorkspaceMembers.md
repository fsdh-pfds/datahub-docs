# Inviting your colleagues to your workspace

![ezgif-5-d67c30bfce](https://github.com/ssc-sp/datahub-docs/assets/56747050/525383db-6a82-46a0-b323-f62211d07c11)

Once you have filled your metadata, it is a great time to start inviting your colleagues. To do so, navigate to the "Users" tab of your workspace from the sidebar, where you will see all of the current members of your workspace
and their roles. Then click "Invite new user", enter their email and select "Add new user" (if they are not already part of FSDH) or their FSDH account (if they are existing users). Once you have selected all the users you want to add
click the "Add new users" button in purple, then select the roles of the members you are going to invite!

- **Guest** is the default role and has only read access to all resources within your project.
- **Collaborators** is the role that you will want to give to most of your colleagues. It gives them read/write access to most of your resources.
- **Admin** users have read/write access to your resources and can also manage other peoples permissions as well as your workspace tools.
- **Workspace lead** should be given to as little people as possible. They have all permissions on the workspace and are also the business representative for the workspace for potential communications and issues.

Once you have decided a role for all your colleagues, ensure that you click the "Save Changes" button, which will send all the required invitations.

Note that workspace leads and admins can remove members by selecting their role and selecting "Remove User".
