# Static Media Overview

## Static Media

Static media is a collection of files that are served directly to the client without any processing by the server.  These files are typically images, videos, or other files that are not modified by the server.  The server simply sends the file to the client when requested.


## Static Media Storage

The static media is stored in an Azure storage container `fsdhstaticassetstorage` in the `fsdh-static-assets` resource group. There are two containers; `achievements` and `media`.

The `achievements` container contains the images for the achievements and is publically accessible.

The `media` container contains the images for the media page and requires a SAS token to access.  The SAS token is generated by the server on a redirect through the `MediaController` which is accessible at the `/api/media/<filepath>` endpoint.

## Static Media Upload

All static content needs to be manually uploaded to the portal for now.

## Static Media Configuration

The media assets are configured through the `DatahubPortalConfiguration` object. You can override them with the `appsettings.json` file.

```json
// appsettings.json
{
    ..
    "Media": {
        "StorageConnectionString": "<connection string to the storage account>",
        "StaticAssetsUrl": "<url to the static assets>",
    }
    ..
}
