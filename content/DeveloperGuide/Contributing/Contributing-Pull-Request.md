## Opening a Pull Request

In order to start contributing, choose an issue from the [issues](https://github.com/ssc-sp/datahub-portal/issues) page and mark yourself as the assignee.

Create a New Branch from the 'develop' branch. Preferably, prefix the branch name with your initials: `fl/branch_name`.

Open a pull request by navigating to the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ssc-sp/datahub-portal/pulls) page and selecting `New pull request`. Select the `develop` branch as the base branch, and select the branch to be merged in the `compare` dropdown.

Include any relevant comments in the pull request, and tag any relevant issues via [GitHub keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests).
