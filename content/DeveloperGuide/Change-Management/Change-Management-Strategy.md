# Agile Change Management and Configuration Monitoring Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Agile procedures and guidelines for managing changes and monitoring configurations within FSDH using Azure DevOps. Effective change management and configuration monitoring are essential for maintaining the stability, security, and reliability of our systems and infrastructure in an Agile environment.

## 2. Change Management Process with Azure DevOps in Agile

### 2.1 User Stories for Change Requests

- Proposed changes will be captured as User Stories in Azure DevOps using the designated template.
- User Stories should include details such as the desired functionality, acceptance criteria, and potential impact on system configurations.

### 2.2 Backlog Grooming and Prioritization

- The Product Owner, in collaboration with stakeholders, will prioritize User Stories based on business value and urgency during backlog grooming sessions.
- Changes with the highest priority will be selected for implementation in upcoming iterations.

### 2.3 Sprint Planning and Commitment

- During sprint planning sessions, the development team will commit to implementing selected User Stories within the upcoming sprint.
- The team will estimate the effort required for each User Story and allocate resources accordingly.

### 2.4 Iterative Development with Azure DevOps

- Changes will be implemented iteratively using Azure DevOps Agile Boards and Sprint Backlogs.
- The development team will break down User Stories into tasks and track their progress using Azure DevOps Boards and Dashboards.

### 2.5 Continuous Integration and Deployment

- Azure DevOps Pipelines will be configured for continuous integration and deployment to facilitate the rapid and reliable delivery of changes.
- Automated tests will be integrated into pipelines to ensure the quality and stability of deployments.

### 2.6 Sprint Review and Retrospective

- At the end of each sprint, a sprint review meeting will be held to demonstrate completed changes to stakeholders and gather feedback.
- The team will conduct a sprint retrospective to reflect on the sprint's successes and areas for improvement, including the change management process.

## 3. Configuration Monitoring with Azure DevOps

### 3.1. Version Control with Git

- **Purpose**: Git serves as the central repository for storing Terraform configuration files and tracking changes.
- **Strategy**: 
  - **Utilization**: Git is utilized for version control, facilitating comprehensive tracking of configuration changes.
  - **Review Mechanism**: Branch protection and pull request reviews are enforced to ensure changes are reviewed and approved before merging.
  - **Documentation**: Commit messages provide detailed documentation for each configuration change, enhancing traceability and accountability.
  - **Versioning**: Git tags and releases are utilized for versioning and auditing purposes, enabling precise management of configuration revisions.

### 3.2. Terraform State Management

- **Purpose**: Terraform state files store critical information about managed infrastructure resources.
- **Strategy**:
  - **Centralization**: Remote state backends (Azure Blob) are utilized for centralized state management. Both core and workspaces have separate states.
  - **Concurrency Control**: State locking mechanisms prevent concurrent modifications, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
  - **Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups of state files are maintained to prevent data loss and facilitate recovery in case of emergencies, safeguarding against potential disruptions.

### 3.3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **Purpose**: CI/CD pipelines automate configuration deployment and validation processes.
- **Strategy**:
  - **Automation**: Terraform is integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment workflows, reducing manual intervention and enhancing efficiency.
  - **Validation**: Automated tests and checks are incorporated into the pipeline to validate configurations against predefined standards and policies, minimizing the risk of misconfigurations.
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Infrastructure validation steps are embedded within the deployment pipeline to ensure adherence to IaC principles and best practices.

### 3.4. Configuration Monitoring Tools

- **Purpose**: Configuration monitoring tools track changes to infrastructure configurations and detect anomalies.
- **Strategy**:
  - **Centralization**: Terraform Enterprise or Terraform Cloud serve as centralized platforms for configuration monitoring and governance, providing comprehensive visibility and control.
  - **Compliance Enforcement**: Custom scripts are utilized to enforce compliance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.
  - **Alerting Mechanisms**: Alerts and notifications are configured to promptly notify stakeholders about unauthorized or unexpected configuration changes, enabling timely response and mitigation.
