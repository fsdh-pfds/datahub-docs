# DataTalks - Exploring the Power of the Federal Science DataHub 

On May 1 2024, the Data Solutions Team hosted a DataTalks event entitled Exploring the Power of the Federal Science DataHub (FSDH). The session was conducted in two parts. In the first, users of the FSDH solution shared their experiences using the platform and in the second a series of panelists with varying degrees of involvement with the FSDH, spoke to the vision and evolution of the platform and what inspired them to invest time, money, and/or resources into making it a success.
