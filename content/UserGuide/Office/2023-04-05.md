# Office Hours - April 5th, 2023

## Summary

We covered a few topics in the office hour today

- R support in PoC Databricks Cluster

  > For now, projects can create a new custom cluster and it will have R support
  > The FSDH team is also working to make the default cluster compatible with R

- Shell support in Databricks

  > Users can run Shell using "%sh" directive in notebooks but apparently Shell scripts do not support credential passthrough. As a result, users cannot access the main mount point (/dbfs/mnt/fsdh-dbk-main-mount) from a Shell script. However, Python and R are known to work.

- Parallel computing in Databricks
- 
  > A question about the need to write instructions or codes to run parallel computing among Databricks workers?Â The answer is no. The Databricks platform handles the parallelization if using supported language
