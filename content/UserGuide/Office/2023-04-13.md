## Using Azure Databricks for Python Package Management

### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to install Python packages in both the cluster and in the notebook in Azure Databricks, and understand the best practices for managing package dependencies.

It is important to manage package dependencies in Azure Databricks. If you install a package in the cluster library, all notebooks in the cluster will have access to the package. If you install a package in the notebook library, only the notebook in which you installed the package will have access to the package. If you install a package in both the cluster and the notebook libraries, the notebook will have access to the package, and the cluster will have access to the package.

### Installing Packages in the Cluster

To install the pandas package in the cluster library in Azure Databricks, you can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the cluster settings page.
1. Select the Libraries tab.
1. Click on the Install New button.
1. Select the library source. You can choose to install a library from PyPI, a Maven repository, or an uploaded Python egg or wheel file.
1. If you selected PyPI, search for "pandas" and select the latest version of the 1. package.
1. Click on the Install button to install pandas on the cluster.

After you install the pandas package in the cluster library, you can verify that the package is installed by importing the package in a notebook.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]})
df

print(pd.__version__)
```

### Installing Packages in the Notebook

To install the pandas package in the notebook library in Azure Databricks, you can follow these steps:
