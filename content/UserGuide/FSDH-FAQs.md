##	What are the capabilities to be used and evaluated during the PoC? 
-	Cloud storage 
-	Data Sharing 
-	Notebook collaboration 
 
##	Where does the data ‘live’? 
SSC’s Azure Cloud – hosted in Canada. 
 
##	What will happen to the data at the end of the PoC timeline? 
Options are to delete/destroy or migrate to another environment specified by user. 
 
##	What is an Azure storage account? 
There are two key types of storage accounts – these are enabled by SSC and access provided by the FSDH team: 
  - i.	 Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen2) - designed for big data analytics and provides Access Control Lists at the file and folder level 
  - ii.	 Azure Blob Storage - basic storage account - doesn't provide Access Control at the file and folder level but is required for compatibility in certain scenarios. 
 
##	Will I have issues using the FSDH with VPN? 
You may need to disconnect from your VPN to upload or download files. 

##	What are the type of costs that my analytics project may incur? 
At high level, the costs for your project will depend on the following 3 factors:
  -	Compute – the type of virtual machines (Databricks Clusters) that you require for the project.
  -	Storage – the amount of data stored using the Blob Storage service
  -	Cost of any additional services that you may require for your project such as license cost for Power BI, Tableau, SQL Sever Database etc.

##	Where can I see the costing model for the services? How can I track the cost that is being incurred for my project? 
Reports and alerts are configured to enable you to track the ongoing usage and cost of the services consumed in your Workspace.

##	What is the Shared Services Canada Science Program?
SSC created the Science Program to support GC priorities on modernising and securing research in Canada and to better enable scientists with digital infrastructure and services to support their respective mandates. A key priority is to address and remove barriers that inhibit collaboration between SBDAs. 

##	What is the Data Solutions for Science (DSS) Team?
The DSS team in the Science Program is mandated to deliver federal data solutions for Science Based Departments and Agencies (SBDAs) to address common data challenges and strengthen the posture of federal science in Canada. In addition, we seek to eliminate ongoing investment in siloed departmental solutions that don’t meet the needs of the GC science community.  

## Why a Proof-of-Concept? 
A PoC allows for innovation and iteration as we discover and test data solution capabilities that will give scientists the tools they need to support their data management, storage, advanced analytics and collaboration requirements
