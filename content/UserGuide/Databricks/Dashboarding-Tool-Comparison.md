# Dashboards on Databricks Compared to Other Tools

Databricks, PowerBI, and Tableau are all powerful tools used for data analysis and visualization, but they have different focuses and capabilities, particularly when it comes to dashboarding. This article will compare the dashboarding capabilities of Databricks on the FSDH, PowerBI, and Tableau.

## Databricks

**Focus:** Primarily a data analytics platform with a focus on big data processing, machine learning, and collaborative data science.

**Dashboarding:**

* Integration with Notebooks: Dashboards are created from notebooks, which can contain a mix of code, visualizations, and narrative text.
* Real-time Data: Because of its Spark-based architecture, Databricks can handle real-time data processing and display live data on dashboards.
* Collaboration: Allows for collaborative work on notebooks, which can then be shared as dashboards within a team or organization.
* Customizability: Limited compared to dedicated BI tools; however, it supports various visualization libraries that can be used within notebooks (e.g., Matplotlib or Plotly).
* Interactivity: Dashboards can be interactive to an extent, but the interactivity is typically more limited than in PowerBI or Tableau. Dashboards can leverage Python Widgets for interactive inputs.

## PowerBI

**Focus:** A business analytics service by Microsoft that provides business users with tools for aggregating, analyzing, visualizing, and sharing data.

**Dashboarding:**

* Ease of Use: Known for its user-friendly interface and drag-and-drop features that make it easy to create dashboards.
* Data Connectivity: Offers robust data connectivity options to various data sources and has strong integration with other Microsoft products.
* Interactivity: Highly interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities and extensive filtering options.
* Real-time Data: Supports real-time dashboards with streaming datasets.
* Custom Visuals: A large library of visuals and the ability to import custom visuals from the marketplace or create your own.

## Tableau

**Focus:** A leading data visualization tool that is designed to help users create interactive and shareable dashboards.

**Dashboarding:**

* Visualization Capabilities: Known for its strong data visualization capabilities with a wide array of charts and graphs.
* User Experience: Intuitive and user-friendly interface that supports drag-and-drop functionalities.
* Data Handling: Can handle large volumes of data and connect to various data sources.
* Interactivity: Offers high interactivity with features like tooltips, filters, and parameters that can be used to create highly dynamic dashboards.
* Community and Resources: Has a large and active community with a wealth of resources, templates, and forums for support.
