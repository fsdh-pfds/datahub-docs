# Importing an Existing Google Cloud Platform Account

To import a GCP storage account, you will need to create a service account with access to the storage and create a key pair for the account.

1. From the main Google Cloud menu, under the **IAM & Admin** section, navigate to **Service Accounts**.

2. At the top of the screen, click **Create Service Account** and fill in the information for the account. The Service Account ID will be auto-generated by default, but you can re-generate it or manually enter your own desired value.

3. After creating the user, click on its username in the list, and navigate to the **Keys** tab. From here, click the **Add Key** button and select **Create new key**. At the prompt, make sure **JSON** is selected and click the **Create** button. This will create a .json file and download it to your computer.
