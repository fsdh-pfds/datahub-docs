3. Within a few minutes, the database will be provisioned and you will see it in the `Toolbox` tab. If the database does not provision, please fill out a support request.

## How to use your PostgreSQL Database

1. Navigate to the workspace you want to use the PostgreSQL database in.
2. Navigate to the `SQL Database` tab under the `Workspace Tools` category. This page provides you with the needed information to connect to your database.
3. **Before trying to use the database**, you must add your IP address to the firewall rules. 
    * Navigate to the bottom of the page and click `Add Current IP Address` to add your local IP address to the firewall rules.
    * If you switch networks or toggle your VPN, you will need to add your new IP address to the firewall rules.
    * To give Databricks access to the database, you will need to add the address `0.0.0.0` to the firewall rules.
    * **NOTE:** Changes can take up to 15 minutes to apply.

4. After adding your IP address to the firewall rules, you can use the connection info provided for Databricks, Python, R, Java, and C#.
